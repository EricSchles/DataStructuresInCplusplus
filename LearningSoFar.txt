So far I have learned about Inheritance, templates, abstract data types, and enacpsulation.  

Each topic was covered in less than a page and yet I feel comfortable with the topics already.  As I have through each topic I have gained some degree of mastery regarding each.  The most important thing I think I have realized is that Computer Science is a process from abstraction to specification.  It moves in cycles, to accommodate business need.  More work is done over time as a given project gains traction within a company.  However, I'm not sure if that model is really necessary in the world we live in today.  I think it makes more sense to simply spend your time developing.  Sadly, we as computer scientists spend to much time on the details.  That's what we are made to believe as important, whether this is on purpose or not is unclear.  But obviously it is the state of the science.  It is unclear to me whether computer science is actually a science.  It appears are though it is more of a psuedo science.
